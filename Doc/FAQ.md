## **I hear Vulkan® is awesome fast.  How fast is it?**

In our internal tests where we re-wrote parts of other applications the increase is 2X to 50X faster.  And as GPUs get faster the increase will grow. Vulkan® is a cross-platform API made by the GPU hardware vendors (mostly: Intel, AMD and NVidea).  So it's going to be the fastest and lowest level cross-platform option.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Is Vulkan® growing? Is Vulkan® a good choice for the core of an app?**

Yes, Vulkan® is growing, and yes, Vulkan® is an excellent choice for an app core - both now and looking forward.

Because of the important historic role OpenGL took in cross-platform graphics, and the enthusiasm of the hardware vendors - Vulkan® is in a very powerful position for growth and industry transformation in 2020. 

Here’s a detailed breakdown of major players in this market and how the world is shifting towards Vulkan® as the graphics platform of the future:

### **AMD**

* In 2013, AMD created project [Mantle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(API)), a leading-edge graphics API that pushes the entire industry forward
* It had huge improvements in both GPU performance and areas where CPU was the limiting factor
* In a case study, AMD announced the performance in Battlefield 4 was up to 319% faster in Mantle
* In 2015, AMD donated Mantle to the Khronos Group as the foundation of Vulkan®, so a next-generation low-level API could standardize across the industry
* As a founder of Vulkan®, AMD is a huge and enthusiastic supporter 

>Vulkan® supports close-to-metal control enabling faster performance and better image quality. No other graphics API offers the same powerful combination of OS compatibility, rendering features, and hardware efficiency.
>
>[*-AMD Website*](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/Vulkan)

### **Intel**

* Intel is a very active member of the Vulkan® community, and they have lots of excellent example code.  Part of their application code examples grew into the starting point for GpuScript.
* [Jason Ekstrand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3Hyd2sWSvA) is a Lead on the Intel Vulkan® team and is a member of the Khronos Vulkan® working group.  He has also done many excellent presentations on training people to use Vulkan®.

>Just as parallelism and multithreaded programming paved the way for the performance strides of multicore CPUs, Vulkan® APIs are poised to forge a future of multithreaded, cross-platform GPU programming, and high-performance rendering, regardless of the target device.
>
>[*-Intel Website*](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/Vulkan-apis-for-unity)


### **NVIDIA**

NVIDIA has worked closely with the Khronos Group, the creators of Vulkan®, throughout its development.  NVIDIA calls Vulkan®, "The only cross-platform next-generation 3D API," and points out that: DirectX is Windows only and Metal is Apple only.  Vulkan® is one API for all GPUs. See [presentation.](https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/siggraph/2015/presentation/SIG1501-Piers-Daniell.pdf)

>We have been using NVIDIA hardware and drivers on both Windows and Android for Vulkan® development, and the reductions in CPU overhead have been impressive.
>
>*-John Carmack, Chief Technology Officer, Oculus*


### **Google**

In October 2019 Google announced at the [X.Org Developer's Conference](https://xdc2019.x.org/event/5/contributions/576/attachments/441/695/SwiftShader_Lightning_Talk.pdf), "We are all in with Vulkan®."

* Vulkan® is mandatory on Android Q/10, and future Google Phones.  This strategy is called "Vulkan® Everywhere".
* Chrome has Vulkan® support:
    * WebGPU has Vulkan® backend
    * The core drawing libraries in Chrome (SKIA) have a Vulkan® backend
* Fushia is the next generation Google OS for PCs, phones, tablets and IOT devices.  It's 100% Vulkan® - Vulkan® only for low-level drawing
* Google is embracing a Linux + Vulkan® stack for gaming.  Stadia, Google’s cloud gaming service is 100% Vulkan® on Linux   
* Google wrote SwiftShader to run Vulkan® on multi-threaded CPUs so that it is 100% compatible on all hardware - even without a graphics driver or a graphics card

### **Valve**

Valve has funded and driven many important aspects of Vulkan® becoming a full-fledged cross-platform API:
* They arranged for Vulkan® to work simply on Mac by getting MoltenVK to be released Open Source.
* They fund LunarG who creates the main Vulkan® SDK and debugging tools (used by GpuScript).
* They are active in bringing more Windows games to Linux through Vulkan®, especially through the Steam gaming platform.

> We have an ongoing investment in making Vulkan® a competitive and well-supported graphics API, as well as making sure it has first-class support on Linux platforms.

### **Samsung**

Samsung has been involved with Vulkan® the day it started, since they "believe in the importance of high-quality graphics on mobile devices."

Samsung reports: Vulkan® offers the same environment for desktop and mobile GPUs, making the task of writing portable software much easier.

>Samsung and Epic Games teamed up to optimize the performance of global phenomenon Fortnite for Galaxy devices.  Specialized Vulkan® API support and optimized memory usage improved performance on Galaxy smartphones.

Here are neutral parties:

### **Apple**

Vulkan® code can run on top of Metal (the Apple GPU SDK) using MoltenVK.

However coding directly in Metal simplifies deployment on macOS & iOS.  For this reason Row64 considers Metal the best option for Row64 on the Mac / iPad / iPhone.

<br>

***So big picture is there's a very unique "lightning-in-a-bottle" situation around Vulkan® becoming the hardware and software standard for the GPU.  There's really no other candidate. Non-GPU computing is a 100X slower now, and will be 1000X, 10,000X, 100,000X, etc. slower in the near future.***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## **I don't get what you mean by SUI and TUI?  What does this mean?  I don't see it in other Vulkan® projects.**

These are terms that help simplify the 2 major types of drawing pipelines:

1. A complete DIY approach where everything from the UBO to the shader is all custom code. We call this SUI or "Shader UI".
 
2. A quick approach to get stuff on the screen fast using drawing libray calls.  Things like: AddRectangle, AddLine, AddText, ect.  You just make the stuff you need and don't worry about the low-level stuff below.  We call this TUI or "Triangle Based UI Draw Library".

    Often it's useful to use a mix of both, so we made a framework where it's easy to mix them together. We have a more detailed explanation of this topic [here](Tutorials_SUIvsTUI.md). 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Can I use this to do 2D?  To make a desktop app?**

Yes, this is a great platform for 2D.  The Vulkan® community is primarily oriented to games and 3D projects.  We've extended that base and added lots of tools and functions to also excel at 2D projects.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Can I use this to do 3D?  To make a game?**

Yes, since Vulkan® is designed for 3D you can.  Just use the SUI Shader UI to pass 3D verticies, vertex colors and uv coordinates.  

We have a [tutorial](Tutorials_ShaderToy_Particles.md) showing how to run ShaderToy examples here which would help get you started.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## **What is the relationship between this code and ImGUI?**

This code started as a app framework for running multiple Vulkan® pipelines at the same time (the current Shader UI framework).  As we were planning out a 2D triangle submission UI we experiemented with ImGUI and thought it was great.  So we've included it in the app framework.

ImGUI tends to specialize in overlay UI that pops up and changes dynamically.  It's also really good for lists of different type of data.  So it's part of our app and we recommend using it for those cases.

Our team has been doing over 20 years of UI programming so we had quite a few app development cases (esp for business apps) that were outside of how ImGUI was working.  The major scenario is where UI panes are designed in Illustrator or Photoshop and you want to make a pixel accurate replica in the UI.  ImGUI, like QT tends to lean towards automated layout.

So we added our own general drawing and UI Library found in UILib.cpp for this type of scenario.

So we like ImGUI, and consider it a sister product we've embedded.  You may find both libraries useful for different scenarios and call both.  In our documentation "Triangle UI" refers to the combination of ImGUI & UILib.

We also have some additional UI technology that we're thinking about integrating that could widen the scope even more.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## **I'm not familiar with immediate mode UI coding, how can I learn it?**

Immediate Mode UI programming is amazing, this is a great intro about the concepts:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1qyvQsjK5Y&t=2s

The great power of immediate mode UI is only what is drawn is evaluated in code.

>
> *The fastest instruction is the one that is never executed.*
>
> -- **<cite>Michael Abrash</cite>**
>

It also changes the way you think about events.  Instead of thinking about triggers when IO events happening, you use state (InputStateData, DisplayStateData) to read what has changed.


However there is a UI idea that we consider beyond Immediate Mode - that is the UI built by fragment shaders.  


> *Learning to write graphics shaders is learning to leverage the
> GPU with its thousands of cores all running in parallel*
>
> -- **<cite>Omar Shehata</cite>**
>

Fragment shader UI has the potential to be mind-blowing fast because everything is calculated in parallel.  A good inspiration reference for this was made by Intel called [FastUIDraw](https://github.com/intel/fastuidraw).  Although it never took off the ideas are amazing and it was around 10X faster than any other UI approach:
https://github.com/intel/fastuidraw

So the UI framework in this Example App should be a great starting point for doing this type of experiment.  Of course the basics of displaying chunks of textures are covered in our docs, but there is another potential UI frontier beyond that.  You may also want to look at [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/), they have many fascinating experiments with UI and shader generated text: 
https://www.shadertoy.com/

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Can you explain more about using State instead of Events?**

Ok to start big picture you can use events if you choose, all the GLFW event callbacks are in: [c_Window.cpp](../Include/Core/c_Window.cpp)

However, this is not a great for mouse and keyboard events because they can easily occur in the middle of drawing and get trampled.  When using the UILib you don't even need to think of this, for example calling:

```cpp
UILib::DragStart()
```

will return true for only one frame of drawing.  So you can do something more complicated like begin a drag rectangle.  And you're guaranteed to be aligned with the Vulkan® draw.

Under the hood this is happening both in `PipelineManager::UpdateUIInputs` and ImGui. They make sure that a change value is only for one frame.  Either carrying over last value (mouse change) or buffering values (key change) and filling state.
